	// Parts
		#NTG-adapter-half-titl = TG-018-A Tiny Girder to Half Meter Adapter
		#NTG-adapter-half-desc = This little widget lets you go from half, errr, zero point six two five (i dont feel like changing every name in the mod sorry) meter parts to the tiny girder system. 
		#NTG-adapter-half-tags = half meter adapter

		#NTG-dock-titl = TG-018-DP Tiny Girder Docking Port
		#NTG-dock-desc = Its the littlest tiniest docking port ever. It supports refueling too so i guess you can service sattelites with it.
		#NTG-dock-tags = dock

		#NTG-explodie-titl = TG-018-E Tiny Exploding Girder
		#NTG-explodie-desc = Heres a couple miniscule girders held together with explosive bolts. Dont let jeb near the detonator and everything should be fine.
		#NTG-explodie-tags = tiny decouple explod separat

		#NTG-huge-titl = TG-018-H Huge Tiny Girder
		#NTG-huge-desc = A very oxymoronic girder, its small but its the big one. In the land of primal dwarfs the regular dwarf is king.
		#NTG-huge-tags = huge

		#NTG-large-elbow-titl = TG-018-B-L Tiny Elbow Girder, Big Edition
		#NTG-large-elbow-desc = A 90 degree elbow for your tiny girders, this one is bigger (not that you could tell). Who stole my beer?
		#NTG-large-elbow-tags = elbow

		#NTG-large-hub-tank-titl = TG-018-H-L-T Tiny Girder Large Wet Hub
		#NTG-large-hub-tank-desc = Hey look somone got the tiny large hub wet. Wet in the sense that its full of monoprop. Nice!
		#NTG-large-hub-tank-tags = large hub wet tank

		#NTG-large-hub-titl = TG-018-H-L Tiny Girder Large Hub
		#NTG-large-hub-desc = A slightly larger hub for a little tiny construction kit.
		#NTG-large-hub-tags = large hub

		#NTG-large-titl = TG-018-L Large Tiny Girder
		#NTG-large-desc = Is that a girder in your pocket or are you happy to see me? No, Im totally not compensating for something.
		#NTG-large-tags = large

		#NTG-medium-tank-titl = TG-018-M-T Medium Tiny Wet Girder
		#NTG-medium-tank-desc = Jeb got high one day and thought it would be cool to cram lf+oxy tanks into a girder. Just remember most tiny giders cant feed fuel so be sure to use fuel lines. Jeb didnt, and hes floating out in the vacinity of laythe right now waiting on a rescue craft.
		#NTG-medium-tank-tags = medium wet tank

		#NTG-medium-titl = TG-018-M Medium Tiny Girder
		#NTG-medium-desc = All things in moderation, especially diminutive girders.
		#NTG-medium-tags = medium

		#NTG-miniscule-titl = TG-018-MN Miniscule Tiny Girder
		#NTG-miniscule-desc = Ok this is starting to get rediculous. What is this even useful for?
		#NTG-miniscule-tags = miniscule

		#NTG-octo-hub-titl = TG-018-H-O Tiny Girder Octo-Hub
		#NTG-octo-hub-desc = This is a hub that fits with the structural lattice kit and can take 8 other tiny girders around the side.
		#NTG-octo-hub-tags = octo hub

		#NTG-small-elbow-titl = TG-018-B-S Tiny Elbow Girder, Small Edition
		#NTG-small-elbow-desc = They said i couldnt bend such a tiny girder 90 degree. They said i couldnt do it but i said i could or my name isnt Bender Bending Rodriguez. Bite my shiny metal ass Jeb. 
		#NTG-small-elbow-tags = elbow

		#NTG-small-hub-titl = TG-018-H-S Tiny Girder Small Hub
		#NTG-small-hub-desc = A little tiny hub for a little tiny construction kit.
		#NTG-small-hub-tags = small hub

		#NTG-small-tank-titl = TG-018-S-T Small Tiny Wet Girder
		#NTG-small-tank-desc = Cute, and can contain fuel too! Wow! Xenon in this case.
		#NTG-small-tank-tags = small wet tank

		#NTG-small-titl = TG-018-S Small Tiny Girder
		#NTG-small-desc = Awww, its so cute! Can i hold it?
		#NTG-small-tags = small

		#NTG-thruster-arcjet-lf-titl = TG-018-AJT Tiny Girder Mounted Arcjet Thruster
		#NTG-thruster-arcjet-lf-desc = Heres a small thruster you can use for either reaction control or as a main engine for your tinyprobe. This one is an arcjet so it uses electrical power to increase the isp of an lf+oxy engine.
		#NTG-thruster-arcjet-lf-tags = lf oxy arcjet engine thruster

		#NTG-thruster-ion-titl = TG-018-MPD Tiny Girder Mounted MPD Thruster
		#NTG-thruster-ion-desc = If arcjets arent your thing you can use this MPD thruster instead. It uses more power and runs on xenon, but it emits pretty blue light whilst humming quietly.
		#NTG-thruster-ion-tags = ion mpd xenon engine thruster

		#NTG-tiny-titl = TG-018-T Tiny Tiny Girder
		#NTG-tiny-desc = Kinda redundant isnt it? Sorry i like tiny girders.
		#NTG-tiny-tags = tiny
